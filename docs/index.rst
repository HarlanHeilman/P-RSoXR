This documentation contains tutorials for collecting, reducing, and processing Polarized Resonant Soft X-ray Reflectivity taken at Beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source. Methods were developed by the Polymers Processing Group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The associated software package *PyPXR* is a collection of open-source utilities for modeling **P**\ olarized **X**\ -Ray **R**\ eflectivity using a 4x4 transfer matrix formalism. This package was originally forked from the `refnx`_ curvefitting software developed by Andrew Nelson.
