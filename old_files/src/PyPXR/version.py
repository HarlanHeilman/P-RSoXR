version = '0.2.0'

"""
0.2.0 - Restructured the code in advance for release. Names and function calls have been updated to better reflect their purpose and for ease of use.

Basic functionality of ani_reflect has been implemented

0.1.04 - Added a uniaxial approximation to the calculation, increased speed 8x

0.1.03 - Cleaned up '_ani_reflect' and added numba functionality to speed up matrix calculations

0.1.02 - Updated ani_structure with 'ani_NexafsSLD'
    Allows for an SLD object to be generated form an external NEXAFS file
    Other quality of life changes, loading data in terms of delta and beta and not a dielectric constant among others.

0.1.01 - Updated ani_structure with 'ani_MaterialSLD'
    Allows for an SLD object to pull delta and beta from 'periodictable' for isotropic materials (such as substrates)
