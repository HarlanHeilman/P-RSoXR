*Polarized Resonant Soft X-ray Reflectivity*
=========================================================================================
PyPXR is a collection of open-source utilities for modeling **P**\ olarized **X**\ -Ray **R**\ eflectivity. This document contains tutorials on collecting, reducing, and processing data taken at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source. Methods outlined in this document were developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to advance the quality and understanding of p-RSoXR for soft matter applications.
