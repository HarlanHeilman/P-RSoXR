# PyPXR
Open-source utilities for modeling Polarized X-ray Reflectivity using a anisotropic transfer matrix formalism. The roots of this package were originally forked from the refnx.reflect layer model developed by Andrew Nelson.

This package requires the use of refnx in order to model and fit data : https://refnx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Some functionalities have been forked and repurposed from other open-source utilities:
D. Dietze's FSRStools : https://github.com/ddietze/FSRStools
M. Jeannin pyGTM : https://github.com/pyMatJ/pyGTM
P. Dmitriev PyATMM : https://github.com/kitchenknif/PyATMM

Results produced from the main-branch uniaxial calculation have been published and can be found online
