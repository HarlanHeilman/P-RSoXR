# P-RSoXR
Codebase for analysis of polarized soft X-ray reflectivity

Update 08/04/2020: Added new 'uniaxial_reflect.py' function that calculates the reflectance under a uniaxial approximation. Added a toggle switch in the model to decide type of fit. Improves speed by 8x (as of 08/04/2020) if you do not require the full biaxial solution.

Updated 07/13/2020: The refnx/EMpy folders are no longer used. Further development will be done in the suite of python files held in the folder 'ani_reflectivity'
