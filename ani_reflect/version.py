version = '0.1.02'

"""
Basic functionality of ani_reflect has been implemented

0.1.02 - Updated ani_structure with 'ani_NexafsSLD'
    Allows for an SLD object to be generated form an external NEXAFS file
    Other quality of life changes, loading data in terms of delta and beta and not a dielectric constant among others.

0.1.01 - Updated ani_structure with 'ani_MaterialSLD'
    Allows for an SLD object to pull delta and beta from 'periodictable' for isotropic materials (such as substrates)
